				<h2>About The World:</h2>

				<p">Figment & Clark are just two characters from a larger universe that I’ve 
				been imagining as early as 2017. They serve the Lich, the ancient embodiment 
				of suffering from the underworld who was given physical form when it possessed 
				the body of a dark mage trying to summon it. The Lich was thought to have been 
				slain centuries ago, but it’s acolytes have risen again, creating portals to 
				the underworld form which they harvest undead armies.</p>

			<div id="pair1">
				<p>Figment grew up as an outcast from the mage community, ostracized for his 
				large vocabulary, short stature, and lackluster spellcasting skills. However, 
				after being promised access to powerful magic should he join the forces of the 
				Lich, he found his purpose in life. He particularly likes to levitate, obscuring 
				his height with his long cape. He cares deeply for Clark despite his more 
				buffonish moments.</p>

				<p>Clark was raised by wolves in the mountains, only learning about human 
				interaction in knight school (which his wolf parents afforded for him with stolen 
				gold). Though he was kicked out of knight schol for clumsiness, he did soon met 
				Figment, and they’ve been best friends ever since. Clark is kindhearted but not 
				the brightest, often being corrected by Figment (though he only ever corrects him 
				in the nicest way possible).</p>
